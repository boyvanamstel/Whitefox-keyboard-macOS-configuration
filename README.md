# Whitefox configuration for macOS & Windows

This is my configration for [Matt3o's Whitefox keyboard](https://input.club/whitefox) (The True Fox layout).

![macOS and Windows compatible configuration for the Whitefox keyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boyvanamstel/Whitefox-keyboard-macOS-configuration/master/assets/configuration.jpg)

## Key Features

* Modifier keys are setup according to Apple's standard: ctrl, alt, cmd.
* Includes function keys for: volume, media, screen and LED brightness.
* Home and End for when you find yourself using Windows.

## Installation

1. [Download a copy of the configuration](https://github.com/boyvanamstel/Whitefox-keyboard-macOS-configuration/archive/master.zip).
2. [Follow Input Club's guide to install the customized firmware](https://input.club/configurator-setup).

_Note_: The little hole in the bottom of the Whitefox keyboard activates firmware-flashing-mode. No need to take it apart.

### July 4th 2016

Added a 6/N-KRO switcher on the escape key (when fn is pressed). This resolves an issue where media keys won't work in Windows 10 unless you unplug the keyboard and plug it back in. Now you can just press the key to switch modes and you're set.
